GMFMatchPolicy_Criterion_RepresentedElement=Diagrams: Match shapes according to represented elements
GMFMatchPolicy_Criterion_RepresentedElement_Tooltip=Match shapes (graphical nodes or edges) which represent the same element in the same diagram.\nBeware that it only makes sense if an element cannot be represented by different shapes in the same diagram.
GMFMatchPolicy_Criterion_ShapeType=Diagrams: Match remaining shapes according to type
GMFMatchPolicy_Criterion_ShapeType_Tooltip=Certain shapes, generally graphical nodes, are purely technical and do not represent an element: they only make sense in the context of other more significant shapes.\nMatch these shapes according to their type and to more significant shapes.
